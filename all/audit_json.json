		"info":		"\"The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport layer protocol used to support message oriented communication, with several streams of messages in one connection. It serves a similar function as TCP and UDP, incorporating features of both. It is message-oriented like UDP, and ensures reliable in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like TCP.\n\nRationale:\n\nIf the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module not be loaded, disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface.\""
